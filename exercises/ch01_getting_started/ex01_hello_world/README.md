# Exercise 1.1: Hello, World!

Welcome to your first Rust exercise! In this exercise, you'll write the classic "Hello, world!" program.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By completing this exercise, you will:
- Understand basic Rust program structure
- Learn about the `main` function
- Use the `println!` macro to output text
- Experience the Rust compilation process

## 📚 Background

The "Hello, world!" program is a traditional first program when learning a new language. In Rust, it demonstrates several important concepts:

1. **The `main` function**: Every Rust program starts executing from the `main` function
2. **The `println!` macro**: Used for printing text to the console (note the `!` - this indicates it's a macro)
3. **String literals**: Text enclosed in double quotes

## 📖 Rust Book References

Before starting, read these sections from the Rust Book:
- [Chapter 1.2: Hello, World!](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch01-02-hello-world.html) - The main content for this exercise
- [Chapter 1.3: Hello, Cargo!](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch01-03-hello-cargo.html) - Understanding the build system

## ✅ Your Task

Complete the `main.rs` file to print "Hello, world!" to the console.

The program should output exactly:
```
Hello, world!
```

## 🧪 Testing Your Solution

Run the tests to check your solution:
```bash
cargo test
```

Run your program to see the output:
```bash
cargo run
```

## 💡 Hints Available

If you get stuck, hints are available at three levels:
1. **Conceptual**: Understanding what you need to do
2. **Strategic**: How to approach the problem  
3. **Implementation**: Specific code guidance

Use the hint system in the web UI or CLI tool to get progressive help.

## 🌟 Key Concepts

- **Functions**: `main` is a special function that serves as the entry point
- **Macros**: `println!` is a macro (note the `!`) that handles formatted output
- **String Literals**: Text in double quotes like `"Hello, world!"`

## ⏭️ What's Next

After completing this exercise, you'll move on to understanding Cargo and project structure, then basic variables and data types.

Remember: This might seem simple, but you're taking your first step into the powerful world of Rust programming! 🦀
